BYU_SCUT_EXCHANGE_PT
====================

Oral English group project: **hypothetical BYU-SCUT student exchanging project**.

The aim is to persuade hypothetical BYU representatives to choose SCUT as their student exchanging university in China.

## Group members and corresponding responsibilities

* __Ronnie__ Team leader, responsible for overall organization of academic materials, plus campus atmosphere, univ history and famous alumni.
* __Ada__ Team participant, responsible for exchange students from SCUT to the [School of Management of BYU](http://marriottschool.byu.edu/).
* __Luke__ Team participant, responsible for exchange students from SCUT to the [College of Life Science of BYU](http://lifesciences.byu.edu/home).
* __Michelle__ Team participant, responsible for exchange students from BYU to the [School of Architecture of SCUT](http://www.scut.edu.cn/architecture/).
* __Lucifer__ Team participant, responsible for exchange students from BYU to the [School of Materials Science and Engineering of SCUT](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/material/).

## What form of presentation would be like?

Since our professor requires that everyone must participate in the project, I think the most explicit way to reach that requirement is to give everyone a chance of speaking. So the presentation process would be like this: 

* First, I make an overall introduction to our proposed exchanging program, stating the basis of the cooperation between SCUT and BYU.
* Then, Ada and Luke will introduce the program that exchange students from SCUT to BYU.
* After that, Michelle and Lucifer will introduce the program that exchange students from BYU to SCUT.
* Lastly, I will conclude the exchanging program.
