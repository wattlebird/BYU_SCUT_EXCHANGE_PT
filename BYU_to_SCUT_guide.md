# Things to remember when exchange students from BYU to SCUT

I chose the School of Architecture and the School of Materials Science as possible exchanging schools in scut. The reason I choose the School of Architecture is too obvious to speak out. So I think that would be easy. For the choice of the School of Materials Science, I found they had a high contribution for SCUT's SCI papers in MATERIAL SCIENCE MULTIDISCCIPLINAEY.
