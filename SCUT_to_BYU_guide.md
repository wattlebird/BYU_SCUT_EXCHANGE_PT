# Things to remember when exchange students from SCUT to BYU

BYU mainly focuses on its undergraduate education, so it would be better if all the exchange projects are aimed at undergraduate students. I chose the Marriott School of Management is that BYU is famous for its entrepreneurship education, which had a high ranking for many years by different organizations. For the rankings, please refer to [this](http://yfacts.byu.edu/Categories/CategoryList?id=31&active=0). I chose College of Life Science because I found SCI papers in the field of BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY has a big share among all the SCI papers from BYU.
